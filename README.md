# Reactive Forms

- Reactive forms objects are objects that provide us with synchronous access to form value data

- They’re built from observables, so input values and the data value that they bind to are synchronous. Each change in a form state returns a new state.

- This is different from template-driven forms since changes are asynchronous in template-driven forms.

- The synchronous nature of reactive forms makes testing reactive forms easier than template-driven forms.

- the syntax of template-driven forms is closer to Angular.js forms.
