# When To Use Angular Material ?

- Use Angular Material design line: All the components are ready to design with a Material look and feel.
- Provide Google ecosystem design: Material Design is identifiable because it is the default style for the Google ecosystem, so you’d want to use it in - cases where your users want to have the same UI Like Gmail, Android, Google Drive or Google Calendar.
- Build fast: Accelerate a project by using pre-made components, and extend it by using the CDK or Schematics to generate your components.


# When To Look Elsewhere?
Because nothing is perfect, Angular Material has some weaknesses. Let me show a few of them:

No complex and advanced components ready for enterprise applications.
CDK components don’t have good real-world examples and lack documentation.
No commercial or premium support.
Customization of Angular Material CSS for unique design is sometimes a nightmare for non-experienced developers.
