## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

# Angular best practice for projects

> Use Ahead-of-Time (AOT) Compilation

>  Use Lazy Loading

> Minimize the Use of @Input and @Output (beause  tightly coupled and difficult-to-maintain codebase)

> Use OnPush Change Detection

> Use a Production-Ready Build

> Modular Architecture  (Modular architecture allows for better organization and maintainability of the codebase. With modular architecture, functionality is organized into individual feature modules and shared modules)

> Linting (TSLint and ESLint.)

> Keeping the Project and Dependencies Up to Date


# Angular best practice for components

> Naming Conventions

> Reusability

> Single Responsibility Principle

>  Communication Between Components (Property binding, Event binding, Services, ngrx/store)

> State Management

> Testing
